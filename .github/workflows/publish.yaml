Here are a few recommendations to improve your GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Use `env` for Secrets**: Instead of directly accessing secrets in the `run` step, define them in the `env` section.
2. **Add Error Handling**: PowerShell scripts should have error handling to catch and log errors.
3. **Use Cache**: If your build process involves dependencies, consider caching them to speed up subsequent runs.

Here's a revised version of your workflow with these recommendations:

```yaml
name: Publish module
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  terraform_publish:
    name: Publish module
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up environment
        run: echo "Setting up environment variables"
        env:
          PSGalleryApiKey: ${{ secrets.PS_GALLERY_API_KEY }}
      
      - name: Publish module
        id: publish
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          try {
            $apiKey = $env:PSGalleryApiKey | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
            $cred = [pscredential]::new('apikey', $apiKey)
            ./build.ps1 -Task Publish -PSGalleryApiKey $cred -Bootstrap
          } catch {
            Write-Error "Publishing failed: $_"
            exit 1
          }
```

These changes help keep your secrets secure, improve error handling, and lay the groundwork for further optimizations.
